ABOUT
—

Rixel is a display typeface inspired by pixel & 8-bit fonts used in old-school computer games.
Its rounded edges create a strong and modern look that can compliment your editorial design for magazines and posters.

At the end of the day as long as you use it for something fun, you're doing the right thing!
